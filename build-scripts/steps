Do "step1" (the script)

move build, destdir, and logs into step1-results.  You can tar them up
and put them aside if you want to (or just delete them if you don't
believe in Murphy).

Do "step2" and repeat the above moving of the same three directories.

Do "step3".  This will die when it tries to tar the tar on top of the
tar.  I just deleted the tar from ${PUBLIC_BASE} and repeated step3.

After that, hide or delete the same build, destdir, and logs
directories.

Now, we need to find getopt.h
