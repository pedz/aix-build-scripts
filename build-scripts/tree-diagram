# How the tree looks.

${PUBLIC_BASE}: the base of the whole tree.  This will
correspond to /usr/local so this will be used as PREFIX.

${PUBLIC_BASE}/work : Work related files where the
source, build scripts, and download images will be held

${PUBLIC_BASE}/work/build-scripts : The build scripts

${PUBLIC_BASE}/work/packages : This is the top of the
tree for each package.  A package is something like "make-3.82" or
"bash-4.2" or "gcc-4.5.2".

${PUBLIC_BASE}/work/packages/* : for example
${PUBLIC_BASE}/work/packages/make-3.82

${PUBLIC_BASE}/work/packages/*/src :
${PUBLIC_BASE}/work/packages/*/build :
${PUBLIC_BASE}/work/packages/*/destdir : Right now, each
of these repeats the name of the package twice.  I'm not sure I like
that.  For example, for make-3.82, the set of directories will be:

${PUBLIC_BASE}/work/packages/make-3.82/src/make-3.82
${PUBLIC_BASE}/work/packages/make-3.82/build/make-3.82
${PUBLIC_BASE}/work/packages/make-3.82/destdir/make-3.82

${PUBLIC_BASE}/work/images : directory of the download
images
