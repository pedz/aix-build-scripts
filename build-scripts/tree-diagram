# How the tree looks.

/gsa/ausgsa/projects/r/ruby: the base of the whole tree.  This will
correspond to /usr/local so this will be used as PREFIX.

/gsa/ausgsa/projects/r/ruby/work : Work related files where the
source, build scripts, and download images will be held

/gsa/ausgsa/projects/r/ruby/work/build-scripts : The build scripts

/gsa/ausgsa/projects/r/ruby/work/packages : This is the top of the
tree for each package.  A package is something like "make-3.82" or
"bash-4.2" or "gcc-4.5.2".

/gsa/ausgsa/projects/r/ruby/work/packages/* : for example
/gsa/ausgsa/projects/r/ruby/work/packages/make-3.82

/gsa/ausgsa/projects/r/ruby/work/packages/*/src :
/gsa/ausgsa/projects/r/ruby/work/packages/*/build :
/gsa/ausgsa/projects/r/ruby/work/packages/*/destdir : Right now, each
of these repeats the name of the package twice.  I'm not sure I like
that.  For example, for make-3.82, the set of directories will be:

/gsa/ausgsa/projects/r/ruby/work/packages/make-3.82/src/make-3.82
/gsa/ausgsa/projects/r/ruby/work/packages/make-3.82/build/make-3.82
/gsa/ausgsa/projects/r/ruby/work/packages/make-3.82/destdir/make-3.82

/gsa/ausgsa/projects/r/ruby/work/images : directory of the download
images
