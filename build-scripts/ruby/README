The scripts in here may or may not work -- usually they do.  But I want
to modify them and change their destination directory to be more
specific.  e.g. the prvm scripts need to somehow specify a prvm
specific destination directory so they don't get mingled with the other
versions.  And the ecurep versions need to do the same thing.  Plus,
I'll have something for blue diamond.
