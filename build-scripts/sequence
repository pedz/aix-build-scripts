Starting with these in /usr/work/images
    make-3.82
    bash-4.2
    sed-4.2.1
    tar-1.26
    gcc-4.2.4

and the gcc RPM from the aix tool kit and the scripts in build-scripts
and one patch in patches for gcc, you do "step1".

That makes /usr/work/temp with a gcc that isn't brain dead.

I moved build destdir and src into step1 (or you could delete them) and
make sure that these are in images:
    make-3.82
    bash-4.2
    sed-4.2.1
    gmp-5.0.2
    mpfr-3.0.0
    mpc-0.8.2
    gcc-4.5.2

Then execute step2 which makes the above and puts it into PUBLIC_BASE

Now, download wget-1.12 into images, unpack it into src, cd into that
directory and execute Build from build-scripts.  wget will not compile
"out of tree" which is why it needs special treatment.
